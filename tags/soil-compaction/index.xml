      <description>Introduction Soil compaction is the process of reducing the volume of soil by squeezing out air and water, thereby increasing soil density. It occurs naturally over time due to the action of weathering processes, but can also be induced by human activities such as construction and farming. Soil compaction has many effects on the environment, including changes in soil structure, fertility, water retention, and plant growth. In this report, we will discuss the causes, impacts, and strategies for preventing and improving compacted soil, as well as methods for testing soil compaction.</description>
