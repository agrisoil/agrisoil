      <description>Introduction Soil carbon sequestration is a process by which carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the atmosphere and stored in soils. It is an important part of the global carbon cycle, which helps to regulate climate and contributes to global food security. Soil carbon sequestration is achieved through the growth of plants, which take up atmospheric CO2, release oxygen, and store carbon in their roots and leaves. The carbon is then stored in the soil as organic matter, which can be further stored in the form of humic acids, proteins, and other compounds.</description>
